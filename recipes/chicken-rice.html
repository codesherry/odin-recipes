        <p>
          This dish is a combination of 2 dishes Boiled Rice (I know it's not a
          proper dish) and Chicken Boneless Curry. This is very easy to make and
          very delicious to eat. I always eat it as my post-workout meal but
          often eat it in lunch or dinner. Your can make as many platers as once
          as you like and microwave them before you want to eat.However, this is
          the recipe for 1 plater, I usually make 2 platers at once and store it
          for next day for my ease.
